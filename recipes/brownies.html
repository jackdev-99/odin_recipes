    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are the perfect fudgy brownies—rich, dense, and chewy with that classic shiny, crackly crust. This recipe uses cocoa powder and melted butter for a deep chocolate flavor that satisfies any craving.</p>
    <p>The prep time is minimal, taking only 15 minutes, with a bake time of about 30 minutes. This recipe yields 12-16 brownies.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips if desired.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. The edges should look set, and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out with moist crumbs.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely before slicing to ensure the fudgy texture sets correctly.</li>
    </ol>
