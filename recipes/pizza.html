    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple, classic pizza recipe starts with an easy homemade dough and is topped with a simple tomato sauce, mozzarella, and your favorite toppings. It's a quick weeknight dinner that is infinitely customizable and always satisfying.</p>
    <p>The dough takes about an hour to rise, but the actual assembly and baking time is less than 30 minutes, serving 4 people.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1/4 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (105°F - 115°F)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl and let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, olive oil, and salt. Mix until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled.</li>

        <li>Transfer dough to a greased pizza pan or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>

        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
